4. Configure additional options as needed:
   - Select your preferred model

## Models

The Venice AI integration automatically filters and displays only models that support function calling, which is required for Home Assistant device control.

The current default model is Llama 3.3 70B (llama-3.3-70b), which provides excellent function calling capabilities for smart home automation.

For reasoning models like Venice Reasoning (qwen-2.5-qwq-32b) or DeepSeek R1 671B, you can disable thinking for lower latency by enabling the "Disable thinking" option in the configuration.
